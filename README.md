**Short form gaming clips scroller**

This project is a simple web application that allows users to scroll through short gaming clips. As the user scrolls downward, new video content is dynamically loaded and displayed, creating a seamless feed-like experience similar to modern social media platforms.

**How to run**
-Run index.html to start
-scroll downwards to generate a new video

*demos:*
-Run "user_interface/page/feed.html" to run the website with old data system, this is what index.html redirects to, stable
-Run flask and "user_interface/page/feed_new.html" to run the website with database integrated, potentially unstable
-Run flask and "user_interface/page/upload.html" to run the upload page
-Run flask and "user_interface/page/login.html" to run the login page, potentially unfinished
-Run flask and "user_interface/page/register.html" to run the register page, potentially unfinished

**IMPORTANT** 
**You must have flask installed, be in the database folder (./database) and type python app.py in the terminal for the database to connect to our javascript backend**
not all demos use flask
